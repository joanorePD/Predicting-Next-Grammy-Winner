Statistical Learning: guidelines for final project
The final project of the course will consist of a project done in teams of 2 or 3 peo-
ple (single person teams could also be exceptionally allowed after motivated request to the
lecturer).

   The project should go through the following steps:

  1. Obtaining data.
     Explain how you obtained the data.

  2. Clean and filter data.
     This process involves organizing and tidying up the data, removing what is not needed
     and identifying what is missing. In this process, you may also need to convert the
     data from one format to another and consolidate everything into one standardized
     format across all data.

  3. Explore data.
     Once your data is ready to be used you will have to examine the data. Usually, in a
     work environment, your boss will just throw you a set of data and it is up to you to
     make sense of it. So it will be up to you to help them figure out the relevant questions
     and formalize them into “data science” questions.
     To achieve that, we will need to explore the data. First of all, you will need to inspect
     the data and its features. Recall also that different data types like numerical data,
     categorical data, ordinal data etc. require different treatments.
     Then, the next step is to compute descriptive statistics and utilise data visualisation
     to help to identify significant patterns and trends in the data.

  4. Model data.
     In this step you may, for example, use regression and predictions for forecasting future
     values, and classification to identify groups.
     One of the first things you need to do in modelling data is to reduce the dimensionality
     of your data set. Not all your features or values are essential to predicting your model.
     What you need to do is to select the relevant ones that contribute to the prediction
     of results or apply shrinkage regressions.

  5. Interpreting data.
     Interpreting data refers to the presentation of your analysis. Technical details are nec-
     essary but make an effort to make you presentation accessible also to a non-technical
     audience. You should deliver the results to answer the questions you asked when we
     first started the project, together with the actionable insights that you found through
     the process.

In this process, technical skills only are not sufficient. One essential skill you need is
  to be able to tell a clear and actionable story.

6. Deliveries.
   Every team is supposed to produce:

     - A final report detailing the data collection, analysis, and results. This should also
       contain the R commands and the corresponding outputs. The use of Markdown
       with knitr is suggested.
     - A slide presentation. The presentation time is 30 minutes for a group of 3 and
       20 minutes for a group of 2.
     - Both the report and the slides are to be uploaded on a suitable “Assignment”
       on the Moodle page of the course at least four days before the date of the
       exam.
     - Please, register to the exam on uniweb at least one week before the exam and
       send an email to the lecturer with the names of the members of your group.
