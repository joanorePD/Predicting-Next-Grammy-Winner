# What makes a rock song award winning?

## Introduction

This statistical learning project, undertaken as the final assignment for the Statistical Learning course in the Data Science master's program, delves into the exploration of common traits among award-winning rock songs. The central question guiding our investigation is: What common traits, if any, do award-winning rock songs contain? Can intrinsic traits of songs, combined with metrics defined by Spotify, be analyzed to determine award-winning musical features?

In this project, we meticulously break down our data collection, data processing, and data analysis of a dataset containing approximately 1,000 popular songs, encompassing both award-winning and non-award-winning tracks. Our objective is to unravel patterns and insights that contribute to the distinction between award-winning and non-award-winning musical compositions. The project involves the application of various statistical learning techniques learned throughout the course, incorporating API utilization and web scraping methods for a comprehensive analysis.

## Project Files

### R Markdown File

The main project file is named "SLModBFinalProject.Rmd." This R Markdown file contains all the necessary elements for the execution of the project. For easier reading, a PDF version of the file is also provided.

### Data Scraping Folder

The "Data Scraping" folder contains the files used to obtain information from both Spotify and the Grammy website. The files within this folder are numbered in the order they should be executed to regenerate the dataset.

## Project Execution

To replicate the dataset, execute the scraping files in the specified order within the "Data Scraping" folder.

## Project Highlights

This project provided an excellent opportunity to apply the statistical learning techniques acquired during the course to address a specific musical analysis question. It involved the use of APIs and web scraping methods to gather data, adding an extra layer of complexity and practical application.

Despite the outcome not meeting our initial expectations, we take pride in the comprehensive process we followed throughout the project.

## Project Files Overview

- **SLModBFinalProject.Rmd:** Main R Markdown file for project execution.
- **SLModBFinalProject.pdf:** PDF version of the main R Markdown file.
- **Data Scraping:**
  1. **1_get_info_grammy.R:** Grammy website data scraping script.
  2. **2_get_info_spotify.R:** Spotify data scraping script.

## Conclusion

This project not only served as a culmination of our learning but also allowed us to explore and implement various techniques in a real-world scenario. The challenges faced and overcome during the project contribute significantly to our overall understanding of statistical learning in the context of data science.
